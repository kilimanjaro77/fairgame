ONLY DO THIS AFTER BOT's Installation (=pip3 install pipenv, pipenv install and your configuration)

Since MacOS users can't execute the bot by double clicking a .bat file, I made this easy-to-modify script that basically executes the bot by just double clicking. 

Instructions
1. Open Script Editor (MacOS Propietary code editor already installed in your computer)
2. Copy and paste "launch_bot_amazon" code into the editor. 
3. Change "cd ~/desktop/fairgame” to your bot's path location. (For example if your bot's location is in the documents folder use "cd ~/documents/fairgame")
4. Select File -> Export to your bot's folder as an application (select this on file format). Also don't select any options and make sure the code is not signed.  
5. Double click your new file to launch the bot and enjoy. 

I will continue to improve this bot for MacOS users. I will try to find cleaner ways to code this if possible. English is my 2nd languague so it can be a bit difficult to understand what I'm trying to say. Feel free to ask.
