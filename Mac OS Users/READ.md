Since MacOS users can't execute the bot by double clicking a .bat file, I made this easy-to-modify script that basically executes the bot by just double clicking. 

Instructions
1. Open the script file with Script Editor (MacOS Propietary code editor already installed in your computer)
2. Change "cd ~/desktop/fairgame‚Äù to your bot's path location. (For example if your bot's location is in the documents folder use "cd ~/documents/fairgame")
3. Export it to your bot's folder as an application (select this on file format). Also don't select any options and make sure the code is not signed.  
4. Double click your file and enjoy

I will continue to improve this bot for MacOS users. I will try to find cleaner ways to code this if possible. English is my 2nd languague so it can be a bit difficult to understand what I'm trying to say. Feel free to ask.
